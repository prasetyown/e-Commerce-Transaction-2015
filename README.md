# e-Commerce-Transaction-2015

In this project, i tried to make data visualization dashboard using Google Looker Studio (previously Google Data Studio) about e-commerce transaction over the world in 2015. 

As you can see in the first pages, there are monthly profit trend, top 5 countries with most transaction, top 5 products category, and sales overview

And in the second pages, there are transaction geo chart, shipping mode, order priority and miscellaneous data
